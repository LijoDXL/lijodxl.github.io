I am a PhD scholar, studying the physics of interaction between ocean and
atmosphere, especially the interaction during passage of a Tropical Cyclone. I
use computer models to simulate such extreme weather events and study its
associated ocean response. It requires me to be familiar with subjects like 
physics, statistics, and programming to perform such studies. Since, the output
from these models are of huge size, I take help from the field of Big Data Analysis
and the tools built around it to explore meaningful results from the simulations.
My tool of choice for such tasks is Python as it is constantly evolving 
catering to the need of Big Data Analysis and to some extent Physical
Oceanography. Another reason I keep falling back to using Python is the Open Source Community,
who keep the tools alive and updated. Most of the time, you can find a piece of
code that you are struggling with been done or asked my somebody else in
the community, which means you don't have to re-invent it. You can collaborate with them, find a
solution and make it available to others as well.
