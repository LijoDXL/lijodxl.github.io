I am a Ph.D. scholar, studying the physics of the interaction between ocean and
atmosphere. My area of research focuses on the coupling between air and sea
during the passage of a Tropical Cyclone. I use computer models to simulate such
extreme weather events and study the ocean response associated with it. To
perform such studies, it requires me to be familiar with subjects like physics,
statistics, and scientific programming. Since the output from these models is
usually in the range of Gigabytes, I take help from the field of Big Data
Analysis and the tools built around it to explore meaningful results from the
simulations. My weapon of choice for such tasks is Python, as it is continuously
evolving catering to the need for Big Data Analysis and some extent, Physical
Oceanography. Another reason I keep falling back to Python for scientific
analysis is the Open Source Community. They are the ones who keep the tools
alive and updated. When struggling with a piece of code, chances are someone
already asked this question in the community. A solution may have already been
reported, which means we do not have to re-invent it. If not,  open an issue and
collaborate with other people to find a solution and make it available to
others. This philosophy of open source development goes a long way in broadening
programming knowledge as well as helps in creating a good repo amongst the
community.
