This tutorial is made using a set of `Jupyter Notebooks` and `markdown` files rendered as html pages using
[**Jupyterbook**](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). The documentation on `JupyterBook`
page is thorough and it covers many use cases. It will get you started on building
a simple yet elegant looking static website with minimum effort.
It can also be used to create publication quality documentations and books.
